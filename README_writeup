The test suite tests for all the conditions of valid input including
leading whitespaces, trailing whitespaces and both of them. It also checks
for empty string and only a single whitespace without any characters.
the test suite acheives 100% branch coverage and from the structural testing
scenario the implementation can be accepted.
but the implementation does not pass all the tests.
The function does not return correct value when there are trailing contiguous 
whitespaces at the end of the string.
In the test suite, an input of "vai   bhav  " should return the count as 2
but the program returns 1.
Thus since the implementation does not pass all the tests, 
from functional testing scenario,it cannot be accepted since it has errors.
